      With over six years of experience as a full-stack developer, I have contributed to building
      and maintaining mission-critical software used by internal stakeholders while working as part
      of a close-knit development team. I operate within a dynamic technology stack that combines
      custom-built systems with established SaaS solutions. My role has also taken me to field
      locations alongside business partners, where I have provided hands-on support and training for
      end users during software and hardware piloting. Additionally, I bring experience in automated
      unit and mutation testing across both front-end and back-end environments, and I regularly
      collaborate with QA teams to support robust integration testing. I am always looking for
      opportunities to grow and deepen my expertise in delivering impactful software solutions.

          Union Pacific made history on Jan. 6, 2024, when we became the first Class I railroad to
          modernize the "big three" core operating platforms: Positive Train Control (PTC),
          Computer-Aided Dispatch (CADx) and Transportation Management (NetControl).
